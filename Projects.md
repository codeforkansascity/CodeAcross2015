In anticipation of the Spring, 2016 Law, Technology & Public Policy course and the March Code for KC CodeAcross, this group gathered to discuss potential health related projects that might be pitched to the class and/or become part of the CodeAcross event.

Several potential projects were identified, some of which may be feasible for class participation.  The projects discussed were as follows:

* The KMCO Dept. of Health’s Code for America Fellowship project – putting KCMO resident’s immunization records online. The general impetus for this project is to reduce the need for city residents to travel downtown and to stand in line in order to receive a copy of the record.  While the general outline for the project exists, the Code for America fellows will not arrive until February, 2016 to begin the project.  They will be in KCMO until roughly the end of March and then return to their respective home bases to work on the specific project outline.

  * Class project feasibility:  

    *  There may be an opportunity for law students and CSE students to work with 

    * This project will most likely not have sufficient hours to constitute a full the Fellows to help scope the project and work on any health related legal issues, e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) issues.  semester project.

*  The Dept. of Heath EMS group is interested in further development of the Meds/Pods system.  This is a system that allows a large scale deployment of antibiotics.  The problem with the current system is the product is not easy to use.  The KCMO EMS actually own the license for the system and would like to develop a web based online registration and have the system produce a QR code individuals can obtain to speed up obtaining the drugs which must be provided from a dispensary by a human (as opposed to automated teller).

  * Class project feasibility:

    * The group’s consensus was this project may be more of a commercial 

    *  Worth discussing further but perhaps with individuals from ThinkBigKC

    *  MedPods website:   www.nexgenisys.com/medspod.php venture, as opposed to a volunteer effort. 

* Improving access to Medical transportation in KCMO.  One of the largest deterrents to providing health care is the inability of individuals to physically get to health providers for access.  This project envisions creating an online system for identifying the where is it/what is it of transportation opportunities. 

  * Class project feasibility:

    * Ann Marie thought this to be a project that has the highest potential for ROI

    * There is no project team in place for this and so it most likely would be something to pitch at the CodeAcross event and then perhaps become a project 
for summer or fall.

* Another suggested project would to develop a technology solution in the area of social connectedness and health, specifically in the area of increasing civic participation of women.  There is a corollary between people who are active socially and better health status.  This project would focus particularly on women of moderate and less means and find ways to connect them to civic participation projects.

  * Class project feasibility:

    *  This is a very interesting concept but needs further refinement.

    *  There is no project team in place for this and so it most likely would be something to pitch at the CodeAcross event and then perhaps become a project for summer or fall.

* A project that would promote incorporating telemedicine further into the community.  

  *  Class project feasibility:

    * Ann Marie suggested this is a very hot topic

    *  There is no project team in place for this and so it most likely would be something to pitch at the CodeAcross event and then perhaps become a project for summer or fall.
