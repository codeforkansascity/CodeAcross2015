In anticipation of the Spring, 2016 Law, Technology & Public Policy course and the March Code for KC CodeAcross, this group gathered to discuss potential health related projects that might be pitched to the class and/or become part of the CodeAcross event.

Several potential projects were identified, some of which may be feasible for class participation.  The projects discussed were as follows:


* **Improving access to Medical transportation** in KCMO.  One of the largest deterrents to providing health care is the inability of individuals to physically get to health providers for access.  This project envisions creating an online system for identifying the where is it/what is it of transportation opportunities. 

    *  Might have the  highest potential for ROI

* **social connectedness and health** Another suggested project would to develop a technology solution in the area of social connectedness and health, specifically in the area of increasing civic participation of women.  There is a corollary between people who are active socially and better health status.  This project would focus particularly on women of moderate and less means and find ways to connect them to civic participation projects.

    *  This is a very interesting concept but needs further refinement.

*  **telemedicine further into the community** A project that would promote incorporating.  

    * Ann Marie suggested this is a very hot topic
    
* **MAPSCorps** The mapping of community health resources is done by MAPSCorps, which trains and employs local high school students to map a communityâ€™s health assets. This offers meaningful STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) work experiences for the students and others who are employed by this project. Since 2009, MAPSCorps has created 276 active jobs for youth and back-to-work adults, mapped 24 neighborhoods spanning 11 Chicago ZIP codes, and identified over 9,000 community resources
